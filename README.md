# BoostX-Token-API

**buy_tokens.py**
This script defines a `/buy_tokens` command for a Discord bot. It allows authorized users to purchase tokens using the BoostX API, verifies if the user has permission, and saves the purchased tokens to a local file. After the transaction, it sends a confirmation message to the user with the details or an error message if something fails.
